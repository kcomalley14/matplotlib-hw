# Pymaceuticals - Matplotlib Homework
This particular dataset was comprised of two different csv files for study results including timepoint, tumor volume, and metastatic sites, as well as mouse data that includes drug regimen, sex, age, and weight. These were able to be merged by 'Mouse ID'. The larger, merged dataset made it very easy to find the following data:
* Summary Statistics Table for mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of tumor volume for each drug
* Bar plots for total mice per drug regimen using DataFrame.plot() as well as pyplot that is imported
* Pie Plots comparing female versus male mice in the study by using DataFrame.plot() and pyplot again
*
